App creates a file with accelerometer reading.

To see the created file in the android device after you dance :)
Connect your mobile device.
1. Run adb shell 
   Start > Type adb shell > run
2. run-as com.MusicON
3. cd app_logfiles
4. ls

For retrieving/copying file from the mobile device you need to have ADB installed on the machine that comes with ASDK pakage.

Run the following command in your command shell:
adb shell run-as com.MusicON cat /data/data/com.MusicON/[filename].log > [local machine file path]

Example
adb shell run-as com.MusicON cat /data/data/com.MusicON/20131211_145747.log > C:\AccLogs\acc.log
